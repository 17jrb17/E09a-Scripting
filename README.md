# E09a-Scripting

I edited the world, ball, paddle, and labels to react to the balls going off screen and hitting the blocks. When the blocks are hit, the score goes up, however when the ball goes past the paddle and leaves the screen, the life counter goes down. When you run out of lives, a seperate scene engages that just has a label reading "game over".
